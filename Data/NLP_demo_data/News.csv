That want would always have to be programmed in, therefore the freedom is lost. </p> <p>I as a free human could never quite look an ai in the eye and fully know it was not just a programmed machine, because someone had made it want what it wants.

I can&#39;t seem to find powerful enough motors that can be precisely controlled. Ideally, I&#39;d like the end effector to handle up to 15kg payload (arm length is 75 cm), and I&#39;d like the shoulder pitch and yaw RPM to be over 20. I&#39;m inexperienced in robot design, my background is in programming and ML. I was able to find these on 3 different websites:</p> <ul> <li><a href=""https://www.pololu.com/product/2827"">235 g, 250 oz-in stall torque, 80 rpm gearmotor from Pololu</a>,</li> <li><a href=""https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12532"">121 g, 137oz-in stall torque, 30 rpm gearmotor from Sparkfun</a></li> <li><a href=""https://www.robotshop.com/eu/en/12v-5310-rpm-cim-brushed-dc-motor.html"">1280 g, 343.4 oz-in stall torque, 4614 rpm brushed DC Motor from RobotShop</a></li> </ul> <p>Now, I know that operating torque should be about 25% of the stall torque. I&#39;ve also noticed that the last motor does not have a gearbox, and I could get much more torque by attaching one. I&#39;d like to find one that has 132:1 ratio, like <a href=""https://www.robotshop.com/eu/en/banebots-p60-gearbox-132-1-no-grease.html"">this one that&#39;s sadly incompatible</a>. Using a <a href=""https://www.calcunation.com/calculator/gear-reduction.php"">gear reduction calculator</a> the gearbox would take me to 35 rpm and 45,328 oz-in stall torque. Which also seems like a lot (if my math is correct, at 25% of stall torque, it&#39;s the equivalent force of 815kg weighing down at 1cm from the shoulder joint, or 10.86kg at the end effector). Should I take any extra precautions when working with torques this large? Is making a gearbox for the last motor my best option?</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/xwrd""> /u/xwrd </a> <br/> <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/aabpgk/how_to_pick_motors_for_a_diy_robotic_arm_if_i/"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/aabpgk/how_to_pick_motors_for_a_diy_robotic_arm_if_i/"">[comments]</a></span>",Robotics

I started a post-bac BS program earlier this year in CS with the thought of completely getting out of healthcare, but I&#39;m still drawn to the field and after being away from my previous job, I realized it was the workplace itself that I hated and not healthcare.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>So, basically I&#39;m looking for advice on whether or not I should stick with the BS or start an MS. I know with the BS, it would open up opportunities in other fields as well, but I could be done with the MS sooner and it would be cheaper.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/awcoffeeno""> /u/awcoffeeno </a> <br/> <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/healthIT/comments/a98fjj/bs_in_computer_science_or_ms_in_health_informatics/"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/healthIT/comments/a98fjj/bs_in_computer_science_or_ms_in_health_informatics/"">[comments]</a></span>",Health

I&#39;m presently in a MS Health Informatics program (graduating summer 2019). The program qualifies me for the RHIA. </p> <p>How do I get into an app analyst role? My prior, and current, experience makes me more attractive as an HIM applicant, but I want to push more into the HInform route. In my current role I do CPT &amp; ICD 10 coding, billing, and technical charges. I file paper records, handle requests, and follow up with physicians for missing information in their notes. These are job descriptions that are better suited for HIM. But how do I get my foot in the door for an applications analyst job? </p> <p>I&#39;ve started learning SQL and intend to sit for the MicroSoft SQL server certification. I&#39;ve also considered the CompTIA Fund+.</p> <p>I&#39;m open to moving, but the offer has to be right. My only concern about location is that I&#39;m a minority, so I like to tread with cautioun in certain parts of the country. Aside that, I&#39;ll go anywhere for the experience &amp; money. Ideally, I&#39;m looking for salary in the 75k+ range for my next job. </p> <p>So how do I make the jump? I&#39;ve been following internal postings at my job, but so far there&#39;s nothing that I&#39;m qualified for yet. And the postings have been roles such as: QA Analyst for billing/coding, coder, etc. I want more informatics work, with programming &amp; handlong databases. </p> <p>Any advice from?

There is a big problem currently in the second hand high fashion and streetwear market (an estimated 1.2 Billion dollar industry). As I said I am 17, I am unemployed so I have no way to make any money myself, so I started buy and resell limited sneakers to make money. While I was doing this for about two years I would consistently get offers to trade my sneakers with for someone else&#39;s, instead of them just buying them regularly. I never could accept these trades, no matter how tempting because of all the horror stories of my friends trading their high value sneakers for someone else&#39;s high value items and receiving just an empty box or a fake in the mail. That is exactly the problem I identified, high fashion and streetwear resellers cannot risk making trades between items because it is simply too risky in this market. My company idea would give a platform for these trades to take place. Both participants in the trade would send their items to a professional, verified middle man who would receive both items, authenticate them, and ship both items to complete the trade. Feel free to give me any questions or advice, I have thick skin so don&#39;t be worried about hurting my feelings. thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/Ereco""> /u/Ereco </a> <br/> <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneurship/comments/a92my2/what_do_you_guys_think_of_this_business_model/"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneurship/comments/a92my2/what_do_you_guys_think_of_this_business_model/"">[comments]</a></span>",Health

I’ve had the privilege of studying and working in the LATAM, European and US markets, and calling world-class metropolises like Mexico City, Paris and New York my home. In 2016, following my heart, I reluctantly moved to Miami. Today, against all my expectations, I have fallen in love with this region and am ready to bet on its growth. And so is 500 Startups. Curious? Skeptical? Stay with me. As I wrote on the 500 Startups blog last March announcing the launch of 500 Startups Miami, this city and the larger Florida region is heating ... </p>

Can you imagine how difficult it would be to try to connect and get anything done? But that is exactly what is going on with the Internet of Things (IoT) today: many companies are building their own version of authentication and communication protocols that don’t talk to each other, crippling IoT’s growth and innovation. A lot has been written about IoT, and for good reason. By 2020 there will be over 30 billion devices—from cameras and alarm systems to cars and trains—connected to the internet, with billions more coming online every year. Firms spend billions every year to bring IoT devices into these complex ecosystems. Deploying ... </p>

1630,2019 Marketing Stuff,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/aaix2p/2019_marketing_stuff/,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>No particular order. Hope it helps.</p> <ol> <li>YouTube is where it&#39;s at for videos. End of. Get your channel sorted and optimised and connected to everything. Noone is searching for videos on Facebook and IGTV is utter dogshit. Everyone uses the world&#39;s second largest search engine, and that&#39;s YouTube. </li> <li>LinkedIn always was, and is and will continue to be utter shiite for the majority of you. Use it for finding out info on the right people and use tools like CrystalKnows etc to get a more detailed view on those people. Sure, use Sales Navigator to build your contact lists and reach out, but then use the phone to call them. Yes, a phone. If you&#39;re posting organic content on LinkedIn hoping to get any traction at all - then unless you have tits and arse or you&#39;re a young incredibly good-looking bloke or bird that&#39;s made the 3 comma club? Yeah, you&#39;re wasting your time. You can&#39;t even create a custom audience based on post interaction. It&#39;s shit. It&#39;s buggy as FUCK. (OH MY GOD THE BUGS). It&#39;s expensive. Avoid until Microsoft fixes their LinkedIn ad platform. You know how good Microsoft are - because you use Bing as your search engine amirite?</li> <li>Phone calling people on their mobile in 2019 will require you to treat your opening line to them like an optimised rich snippet / email header hook etc. Eh? Because the Google Attendant will be rolled out to all android devices and Apple with respond too, so a call recipient can see in real time your talk to text transcription to see if they want to pick up. See why you need to optimise your opening line now? Yeah, you do.</li> <li>PR never went out of fashion. Everything old is new again or something? Basically, networks of people that trust a Connector person, are your new preferred way of getting exposure and conversions. Pay through the nose for that as long as you can measure and test everything to make sure you&#39;re getting bang for buck. Old mate Suzie Parkus in the UK is my trusted go to chick for this. Find her on Facebook. Who&#39;s the American and Straya counterparts? Dunno. Find yours. Let us all know.</li> <li>Data is a fucking liability. &quot;My database is my joy, mate - what drugs you smoking?&quot; None. Sadly. My point is that GDPR will continue to fuck with your marketing plans time and time again - and you now are officially on notice if you&#39;re an American, that the California Consumer Privacy Act is coming for you January 2020. That&#39;s the Seppo version of GDPR. Now try running two marketing stacks to cater for the rest of Murica and California. Actually, 3 if you market/sell anywhere in Europe. I talked this year at length about GDPR and it&#39;s eye-glazingly dull shit - but important shit. I have a solution to all this for SME business owners, whereas even Facebook and Google and MailChimp etc tell you to go fuck yourself with little to NO tools for helping you become GDPR-compliant with your cross-product marketing stack data. This privacy issue will continue to evolve and deffo continue to give you a headache as most growthhacks and marketing automations require you to process User data with few / zero fucks given to privacy. Just make sure it&#39;s easy for Users to remove themselves for your marketing efforts across ALL your marketing products in your stack <em>cough</em> talk to me <em>cough</em> </li> <li>Email will continue to be a &quot;best effort&quot; technology. Setup your DNS records for all the CNAME and TXT entries under the sun to ensure mail deliverability? Good, because you&#39;ve got one over on your competitors.. but you&#39;re still fucked by increasingly good AI that&#39;s filtering out your emails so they&#39;re never seen by Recipients. Nothing can be done about that. Just know it. If you&#39;re using MailChimp for example though - they&#39;re using AI in there to let you know the best time to send your email based on a multitude of factors and signals. If you haven&#39;t tried it yet, take a squizz. </li> <li>Videos in emails will suck. But then become better. Email and email protocols are as old as the hills, and we keep trying to add new shit on top of that email layer. Video is the latest wheeze. The current tools absolutely suck dick, but they&#39;re the best we got right now (looking at you, BombBomb but hate your retarded price structure). MailChimp and Wistia for example can be a way of sending EMBEDDED PLAYABLE videos from the email (without the user device opening YouTube etc - it actually plays in the email!). But as usual, there&#39;s no standards for this, and iphones don&#39;t play with androids and it&#39;s all still a bit of a cluster fuck. Know it&#39;s doable. Try it out. It will get better </li> <li>Amazon ads will continue to get hot as balls. Yes, even if you aren&#39;t selling products in its platform. They&#39;re complicated and spread across various parts of Amazon, but they will continue to be streamlined into a single AdWords like interface. Who&#39;s my Amazon as rockstar(s)? Make yourself known in the comments. We should talk. Amazon ramping up their video ad offerings too, so get ready to repurpose your YouTube and Facebook landscape product sales videos.</li> <li>AI will continue to eat the lunch of the marketing industry. Yup. AI is at the point where it can already create images that can fool everyone: With actual faces of humans created from just a few seed human face images, it has now learnt how to create images that are so realistic, that you won&#39;t be able to tell the difference. So if AI can do that, it will be able to create images of your products and your ad copy (Google already creating the ad copy but they recommend a human check over the copy - but it&#39;s so good, those checks aren&#39;t really needed I hear). So if you have automatic image creation, ad copy creation tailored to the person reading it based on all the open graph data the social network/ad platform has on you COUPLED with its targeting options that are the best in he history of humanity? Yeah, the digital marketing agency industry is on notice. Make hay now.</li> <li>VR and AR tools still largely suck balls for mere mortals to use, although my mate Cathy Hackl (again, Facebook is where you&#39;ll find her) has all the stories on this and lets me know that those tools are getting way better. Do a Google search for Kabaq, if you&#39;re in the restaurant biz for example - that lead came in from Cathy. Follow her. She&#39;s lush and has the knawledge.</li> <li>Instagram messaging spun off into a separate app called Instagram Direct. And the bots will be there waiting for when Facebook make their commitment to an actual public supported API set. Start thinking how you can take your manychat bot over to the realms of Instagram. That will happen.</li> <li>Paid instagram traffic will shit over woocommerce / Shopify site organic/paid traffic in terms of sales performance. I can&#39;t be fucked with IG myself - it&#39;s full of c*nts with #LivingMyBestLife levels of vanilla tepidness. I post whatever makes me giggle on my @australiawow channel, but that&#39;s about it. But if I was selling physical products? Like fashion? I&#39;d be moving my PPC budget into my Instagram ads to get as much exposure for my channel as possible. Those Instagram shoppable tags coupled with an instant payment solution = pure gold and literal piles of money. The ever-lush TabithaWebb.co.uk is ramping her efforts up on there, and I love the relative simplicity of setting it up for her. It&#39;s straightforward and I suggest you get stuck in too, connecting your WooCommerce and Facebook Business Manager Catalogues and your Instagram accounts. You will have a smile as huge as my pink bits when you get it working. Promise.</li> <li>A few more? Sure, but I&#39;m in the Gili Islands here in Indonesia at the moment, so let me know what you think so far good or bad (and if bad, just be able to articulate why instead of Nelson-levels of digital pointing going HA HAA)</li> </ol> <h1>PLUR my dudes.</h1> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/funkidredd""> /u/funkidredd </a> <br/> <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/aaix2p/2019_marketing_stuff/"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/aaix2p/2019_marketing_stuff/"">[comments]</a></span>",S&E

So our vendors have arranged shipping to a local port (San Antonio, TX Sea Port). We did one previous sea shipment and used a company that we were connected to via reddit which charged us, what we felt like was 3-4 time what we had agreed to. That company handled the entire door-to-door process. We do not want to use them again since it was so expensive. So I&#39;m just trying to figure out, once the goods actually arrive in the port, how do we find a local company that can go there and pick up the goods and deliver them to us?

1633,Unsure about Pricing,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/aac4i9/unsure_about_pricing/,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi everyone. I recently founded a small team of iOS and Android developers (url and name removed due to rules). We convert websites/webapps into downloadable mobile apps using a wrapper (WebView). </p> <p>We thought of it as a pretty innovative focus; if you don’t know what it is, it basically wraps your site as an app and any updates you make to your website automatically cascades to the mobile app. </p> <p>I thought it was a great concept with certainty of succeeding because I am sure a lot of startups have a web application they wish were a downloadable app—and see no reason to rebuild from scratch just to achieve the same functionality and UI. And paying thousands to build an app seems like an overkill. So this solution seems great for those with limited technical expertise or just wants to get the job done— and I thought our pricing was already very low.</p> <p>We started off with plans to charge around $100 per platform (Android and iOS) and thought it’s a pretty reasonable price compared to the only competitor doing the same thing, which is GoNative.io, since they charge well over a thousand dollars for the same service (including push notifications and publishing).</p> <p>Yet it’s been hard to find clients—over the past month, we have only got two and that’s really not sustainable as a business.</p> <p>I am quite unsure whether it’s because we aren’t doing effective marketing, that there just isn’t enough demand, or are our prices still considered too high? Haha, we originally thought there would be an influx of requests for such a low cost. </p> <p>Do you guys think our pricing is reasonable? If not, what’s fair?</p> <p>EDIT: It seems some of you have highlighted it’s probably a marketing/lack of advertising issue—if anyone has tips in the area, that’d be great too.

1636,New Partnership Advice Needed,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/aaggjp/new_partnership_advice_needed/,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hello,</p> <p>I recently left a hostile workplace and another employee also left. At this time, we banned together to start our own organization. Even though I am more senior than my partner (in age and experience), we partnered at a 50/50 split. In hindsight, I feel pretty stupid about this. I am unsure of whether I have any recourse since the agreement has already been signed.</p> <p>Regardless, I am wondering how you might advise me on the following. The other partner, aside from being less senior, only contributes to non-revenue generating tasks. I tackle all the revenue generating tasks, as well as the management of our freelancers, accounting, payroll, etc. I don&#39;t think it is possible for him/her to contribute to revenue generation in a successful way. He/she is not a good relationship builder or a good salesperson. I&#39;m not saying this to slight them at all; they will admit to this being a weakness of theirs.</p> <p>Also, I have to manage my partner because he/she is not good at knowing which tasks to do next or how long to spend on them, etc. So I feel like, in general, I am the main manager of the entire operation and he/she is just an employee.</p> <p>Recently, my partner left to go out of town for Thanksgiving, and I had to cover the business solo for four days. This is not usually a problem, but with Black Friday, we were slammed.</p> <p>Then again for Christmas, my partner left town for a little over two weeks. We aren&#39;t as busy as we were back in November; however, I am feeling like this is not ideal. We are a startup, the space is very competitive, and we need all bodies to be working. My partner left to visit family and has been off the grid. I would be more understanding if this were an emergency and he/she needed to take time off due to a medical or family emergency, but this is just a vacation.</p> <p>Through my efforts, we&#39;ve hit record-high numbers. The first record-high was last month when I was left alone for Black Friday.</p> <p>My question is: do I try to address these points with my partner? I&#39;m not wanting to engage in a conflict if there&#39;s no good outcome on the other end. I&#39;d be fine with being left alone during certain times of the year if I were earning more, but as I mentioned, this is not the case. I feel like he/she is not incentivized to work as hard as possible because it doesn&#39;t necessarily contribute to the bottom line.</p> <p>Should I request bonuses for all the work I&#39;ve done? Tell him/her no more vacations this long and/or that no vacations should be taken because we are a startup?</p> <p>I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s going to take to make he/she realize how important it is to dedicate ourselves to this business almost all day during the waking hours, if we are going to survive.

For the majority of 2018, we had one blogger working with us full-time to write articles (he originally freelanced with us and then we decided to bring him on full-time). The results so far have been pretty stellar in driving traffic that funnels into conversions, and now we&#39;re looking to double down on content leading our marketing efforts in 2019.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>What we&#39;d love to do is bring on a second content writer that has had even more experience in our particular space (social media management platforms) but are having trouble finding someone that is motivated and truly knows what they&#39;re doing. So far, we&#39;ve:</p> <ul> <li>Posted, interviewed, and trialed a handful of writers on AngelList</li> <li>Personally reached out and offer gigs to bloggers/writers who actively write on our subject</li> <li>Searched candidates on Upwork and LinkedIn (with strong filters: content marketing/writer in title and one of our competitors (as well as any SaaS) listed in their experience)</li> </ul> <p>Unfortunately, it seems most candidates from Angel, LinkedIn and Upwork look and sound awesome but about 98% aren&#39;t as capable or experienced as they sell themselves to be (we&#39;ve learned this through trialing a handful of solid-looking candidates). The candidates that we&#39;ve found by way of their articles and that are certainly qualified—and who we&#39;ve reached out to directly—are making too good of money to join us full-time (the convo ends with them offering their services to us as a rate much higher than what we&#39;d like to pay).</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Feel like I&#39;ve written a ton already just looking above all this text. But I&#39;m really hoping someone who has had success with hiring in this area can point me in the right direction/throw me some tips, as we know this will be a huge part of fueling growth in the upcoming year if we get the right person.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Also, and because it matters, we can totally pay market to above market for the right person. The job is 100% remote with unlimited vacation/sick days, and you get to work with an awesome startup that is profitable, has zero debt/outside investors, and already has awesome organic growth.

1642,Issues with CEO and considering leaving company,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/aa5xn5/issues_with_ceo_and_considering_leaving_company/,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>TLDR: I’m extremely frustrated with my CEO b/c of what feels like unfair salary adjustments, manipulation and a general misalignment of values. Considering leaving but I have so much invested.</p> <p>I’ve been working on this startup for 2 ½ years. I am the technical/product guy and for the first 1 ½ years I built and pm’d the entire product. When I first started working with the CEO (will refer to him just as CEO) I was offering up my services as a consultant and billed at an hourly rate for my work. I had a functional Minimal Viable Product that was live in the hands of paying customers in about 3 months. About 6 months later, CEO managed to raise a Pre-Seed round at which point I converted to an FTE (Full Time Employee) as the CTO and Head of Product. We raised another round almost a year ago, after which I quickly hired up a solid team and executed against a series of very aggressive product goals. Throughout the history of this company my team and I have hit every product goal we’ve ever had.</p> <p>The first sign of trouble that I had with CEO was back when I was a consultant. He was often late to pay, sometimes running right up to the date in my contract when I said I would pause services for lack of payment. I tried to be understanding b/c I get how early stage companies work but it was very stressful. He also haggled me on rate and wouldn’t stop pushing and asking me to lower it. This isn’t my first rodeo and I have a lot of experience with people pushing me on rate but he was so persistent and kept insisting that we were “building something together” and I eventually gave in.</p> <p>It was a hard decision for me to come onboard as an FTE but I was excited about the momentum behind the company coming off of the first fund raise. I negotiated a solid cash salary offer that I felt good about. The equity side of the offer was pretty low for that stage (~1%) but the cash side of the offer was really good so I didn’t push too much on it. Then about 3 months after I joined CEO said that investors were concerned about my salary being too high and that for “optics” we would need to move part of it into a quarterly bonus. I didn’t see an issue with that initially until a few months later during another discussion when he said that my bonus would be subject to the company meeting its sales goals, which was &quot;considered normal&quot;. I pushed back as the whole thing felt really unfair and we landed on an agreement that only 50% of it would be subject to sales goals and the other 50% would be product goals.</p> <p>Jumping forward to about a year ago, coming off of our second fundraise and come to find out investors insisted that I have a higher equity stake in the company and even made it a condition of the raise. This put me in the mid single digits (CEO still owns well over 50%). A few months later CEO came to me and said we needed to reduce my salary b/c of budgeting issues. I honestly, don’t remember what the reasoning was behind it but it was agreed to be temporary. Additionally, I was told that I would get another equity grant at our Series A that would give me a couple more cap table points. Knowing that we would likely need another fundraise before our Series A, I pushed for me to get the grant at our next raise regardless of whether it was an A or not. I was told that he would try to make that happen and we both agreed that my salary would be restored at the next round. I was honestly really frustrated that my salary was being adjusted and that I couldn’t get a straight answer on when I would get the next equity grant. At this point the company was showing promise and I was excited about the opportunity to own more of it. I also felt like I deserved it given what I’d produced and that customers were really really happy with the product.</p> <p>Fast forward to last week and we’re getting close to closing our next fund raise. I had a conversation with CEO and he had “forgotten” about my salary being restored. He said it was fine but that he was worried about “optics” b/c nobody else was getting a raise. I was quick to point out that this wasn’t a raise, it was my salary going back to what it should have been all along. Also, I asked repeatedly over the preceding months whether I was getting this next equity grant and he said he spoke to the investors and they were “in alignment”. Come to find out I won’t be getting it. He would never give me a 100% clear answer so I guess technically he didn’t lie but it felt really *really* manipulative.</p> <p>I’m at the point where I’m beyond frustrated. I feel like I’ve been haggled, manipulated and I’m always left “waiting for the next thing” that may never come. On top of the issues with my compensation, CEO has demonstrated what feels like a severe lack of competence over the last year. He hired a batch of about 8 sales people over the summer, when they didn’t immediately start hitting goals he lowered their pay and subsequently fired them several months later. He burned multiple 6 figures on sales people that generated literally $0 in revenue.</p> <p>I’ve seen him back out of contracts he’s made with people and not pay them. He has asked me to break agreements that I’ve made with partners (I refused). He has asked me to tell investors things that were misleading and felt really dishonest (I refused). Additionally, he has made some really significant budgeting errors that have put the company in a really bad position. All the while he refuses to take ownership of his mistakes.</p> <p>Everything else about this job it great. I’m a strong leader in the company that people look up to. I have an amazing, productive, intelligent team of people that report to me that I really enjoy working with. Nevertheless, all these issues with the CEO are causing me incredible stress and anxiety. It’s the holiday break and I’m stressing out. I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about my issues with the CEO. It’s distracting me while I’m trying to relax and enjoy my time off. Startups are stressful enough but this relationship I have with the CEO feels toxic. I&#39;ve had soooo many conversations with him about all of this but I can never pin him down and get him to own any of it. A simple acknowledgement that he made mistakes, was unfair and feels bad would go so far but I know it&#39;s not coming.</p> <p>I am very seriously considering leaving at this point but I’ve put so much into this company. My team is amazing and I’ve built this product from the ground up so there’s a very strong emotional attachment to it as well.</p> <p>Would absolutely love some advice from others out there.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/whattodo949""> /u/whattodo949 </a> <br/> <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/aa5xn5/issues_with_ceo_and_considering_leaving_company/"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/aa5xn5/issues_with_ceo_and_considering_leaving_company/"">[comments]</a></span>",Leadership

I&#39;ve been working on my own startup for about two years and just.launched in December. I&#39;m a one-woman show and am balancing marketing director position at my day job, working 10 hours days, then coming home and working on my startup until the wee- hours into the night. My startup is doing well considering I&#39;ve only been posting about it on my Instagram and haven&#39;t marketed at all, but it&#39;s not doing enough for me to quit my job yet. Every morning I daydream about the day I&#39;ll be able to quit my job and work for my startup.</p> <p>Anyway, today, out of the blue, my boss gave me an ultimatum to work 12+ hours days, because 10 hour days aren&#39;t enough, or else he will demote me to an independent contractor. Obviously, I&#39;m not willing to do that because I&#39;m committed to my startup and I&#39;m not working enough on my startup as it is (only about 30 hours a week including weekends). </p> <p>I see two options for myself: 1. I can work long hours at my job to keep them happy until I find a new job, but this worries me because last time I looked for a job it took me two months, and applying for a job is a full-time job itself so I would have to put my startup on hold. I just put $25k into my startup and now I have no savings so quitting all together is not yet an option, but with my money sitting in the startup I don&#39;t want to put it on hold either.</p> <ol> <li>I can accept the contractor position and focus on my startup full time, but risk not having enough to pay my bills and not reinvesting the money into growing the startup. However, if I sell enough then I could finally approach investors with proof it has growth potential. I know I would work my behind off to pay the bills through my startup, but aren&#39;t you supposed to avoid paying yourself until your startup is further along?</li> </ol> <p>Has anyone else been in this position? I truly don&#39;t know what to do and feel so lost. I want nothing more that to devote my life to my startup but I also want to give it it&#39;s best chance and by taking the profits for my salary I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the right thing to do.</p> <p>Thank you kindly in advance.</p> <p>EDIT: some of you wanted to know what my startup is. It&#39;s called Brush Box Beauty. We launched the entry level product which is a makeup look kit, like Hello Fresh , but for makeup. However, the main product is the first automatic makeup application machine, which I am patenting. It is still in development. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/erbw22""> /u/erbw22 </a> <br/> <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/aa4xmr/im_a_new_founder_and_im_at_a_crossroads_in_life/"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/aa4xmr/im_a_new_founder_and_im_at_a_crossroads_in_life/"">[comments]</a></span>",S&E

1653,Pet food delivery.,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/a9heom/pet_food_delivery/,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I live in an urban area where 3 out of 10 people have pets. I own a cat. Most of these people shop for the pet food at the local pet store. My city has a population of 6.7 million people, thus if we consider an average family size of 5 we get 1.34 million households, out of which 0.4 million (3/10) have pets.</p> <p>Amazon also delivers pet food, but it isn&#39;t same day delivery. Delivery usually takes 3 days. Amazon also charges delivery fees. </p> <p>A local pet store offers me 6% discount on each purchase. I want to test an idea of pet food delivery to houses in my city. If I could take the 3% as my margins and offer the rest of 3% to customer in the form of delivery charges (which basically means that the customer gets the product for retail price, no discount but no delivery charges either) and deliver the product to their house within a day, could this be a viable business? </p> <p>Note: I&#39;d hire a guy to make deliveries and fulfill daily orders on a bike. The delivery boy&#39;s salary and fuel costs will come from the 3%. I&#39;m also ready to give up my part of the 3% initially as I build up traction. </p> <p>Edit: I live in India where my only competition is Amazon and where cost of living is low. I&#39;d have to pay only $120 per month to delivery guy and that would be fair pay. </p> <p>Edit 2: would like to add some numbers to the game-&gt;</p> <p>If out of the 400000 households that own a pet and spend $10 bucks a month on pet food, after fully scaling the business in my city (would take 4-5 months of setup and marketing) if I would be able to get 10% of these to order from my website/call service, I&#39;d get 40000 households X $10 per month = $400000 of GMV per month. Out of which my margins excluding supply chain costs would be 6-8% = $24k - 32k. Which means I would be processing 40k orders a month and 1.3k orders per day. Let&#39;s say a delivery boy could make 50 orders a day, I&#39;d have to hire 26 delivery boys and pay them each $120 per month = $3120. I am left with 24k - $3120 = $21ish k excluding the fuel costs. My city is a 100 km wide, let&#39;s say a delivery guy has to travel each day across the city. Petrol costs $1.2 a litre and Indian bikes have a mileage of 60 km per litre. A delivery boy would thus consume 1.66 litres a day which would add up to 50 litres a month. 26 delivery boys would consume 1300 litres of fuel per month costing me around $1560. </p> <p>Thus ultimately, I&#39;d be left with with 19-20k of margins per month. Let&#39;s take out some additional burn like Marketing costs, advertising on the local radio, newspapers, online advertising, supply chain costs, returns, customer support, bike maintenance, etc. I&#39;m betting those won&#39;t go beyond $9k per month. I&#39;d be left with a healthy margin of $10k per month. </p> <p>This math is of course if everything adds up according to the plan. </p> <p>This would be an MVP of sorts and I am willing to scale this model with other things and to other cities if this works. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/sid2810""> /u/sid2810 </a> <br/> <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/a9heom/pet_food_delivery/"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/a9heom/pet_food_delivery/"">[comments]</a></span>",Neutral

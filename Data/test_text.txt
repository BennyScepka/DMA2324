Assuming familiarity with basic data management and storage techniques (such as ER models and SQL), which – if needed – will be repeated in a bridging course, this course shall teach you essentials of data management and analytics, from the concepts to their application on practical examples (for example applied to Web data but also to business scenarios). 

Firstly, we will focus on advanced databases, storage and data management techniques, analytical queries using SQL and Relational Database Management Systems, but also discuss Document and GraphDatabases. Next, we will discuss how to make certain tasks scale with big data (i.e. high volume, high velocity or highly heterogeneous data). To this end, we will review traditional indexing techniques and methods to deal with concurrent data access and discuss trends in Data Management and Storage. Lastly, we will look into (Descriptive, Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics) Data Analytics techniques and discuss how these can be scaled.

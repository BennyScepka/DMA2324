    "In general, the idea behind supervised learning is as follows: We have a target variable, $y$, and a set of potential predictor variables, $X$, that can help explain/predict the value of the target variable $y$. \n",

    "In general, we distinguish between two types of approaches: **regression**, and **classification**. \n",
    " - For regression models, $y$ is a continuous, numerical variable. Examples are: revenue, payments, cost, charges, customer spending, income, etc. \n",

The test set, thus, represents new/unseen data, i.e., data that has not been used to estimate the model parameters itself.

Specifically, a single training-test split can suffer from a high variance in the estimates for model performance. In other words, if we repeat the training-test split with a different allocation of which observation falls in the training vs test set, the estimates for the model performance can show a rather high variance.\n",

Hence, the selection of good hyperparameters is often done on a separate validation set, and the model performance measured on the final test set.\n",
    "- **Cross-validation**: Here, we divide the data into k parts (folds). We fit k different models, using k-1 of the folds for model training and the remaining 1 fold for testing. The average model performance is then calculated as the average test set performance of the k models. This approach essentially yields a more stable (less variance) model performance estimate.  "

    "### LASSO: A (linear) model with integrated feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in Part 1, we often have many variables in our data, of which not all are going to be useful for our prediction task. Hence, to avoid unnecessarily complex models, we aim to only include variables that are helpful for our prediction tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "We already noted that there are several options for **variable selection** that we can use here: filter methods, wrapper methods, or embedded methods. Here, we are going to consider an alternative to Least-Squares Regression that falls under the embedded method category: **LASSO**.\n",
    "\n",
    "LASSO stands for **Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator**. Instead of minimizing the sum-of-squares as regular least-squares regression does, LASSO adds a so-called **regularization** term to the objective function that we try to minimize when finding the $\\beta$ parameters in our linear regression model:\n",

    "What happens here? Basically, the second term $\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_j^2$ adds a penaly to large $\\beta$ coefficients in the model. Intuitively, if we want to minimize this objective function, we can reduce the penalty by reducing (or setting to 0) the $\\beta$ coefficients of unnecessary predictors in the model, i.e., variables that do not improve the model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, LASSO will set some of the $\\beta$ coefficients of variables to 0, which effectively removes them from the prediction model. Hence, it performs variable selection while estimating the values for the $\\beta$ coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
